# coloredGeneticAlgorithm

That is a college work that I did in 2014 that is a genetic algorithm of colors that, to a given color, try to find what other two collors together can be that color.

The algorithm will try to find 2 children that have RGB values that when added will result the RGB value of the parent.

To run this project just runs `npm install socket.io` and execute the app.js file using `node app.js`.

When executed you can open yout browser in the link http://localhost:3000/ and give a hexadecimal color as input.


P.S. This repository it's just to me save my college work. You probably dont want to read this code.
